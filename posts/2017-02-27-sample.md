# Hello there

Welcome to Haskell, folks, enjoy the ride.

## Look at this nice code we got

```haskell
qsort :: (Ord a) => V.MVector (PrimState IO) a -> IO ()
qsort v = go 0 (MV.length v - 1)
  where
    go :: Int -> Int -> IO ()
    go lo hi | lo < hi = do
```

Nice isn't it?

### Get You Some

more words, i am not at all sure these fonts go together and the words don't even matter. there is nothing but style now. 
```haskell
matches :: Parser a -> Text -> Bool
matches p s = isRight $ parseOnly (p <* endOfInput) s
```

that guy said in the future substance will overpower hype and he was completely wrong. we need to see what like a whole paragraph in this merriweather font looks like don't we? i think it looks very heavy. 

no gods. no masters. only css.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo #-}

module Main where

import Data.List (null, sort)
import Data.Char (isAlpha)
import Data.Validation
```
what would make good code samples for the front page?

```haskell
-- turn off ur damn Prelude
{-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-}

class Floof where

Î»> map (+10) [2, 3, 4]
```
